                    Donating to the causes you care about not only benefits the charities themselves, it can be deeply
                    rewarding for you too. Millions of people give to charity on a regular basis to support causes they
                    believe in, as well as for the positive effect it has on their own lives.

            Online donation platform practitioners often apply information intervention to encourage visitors to donate
            more. Much research focuses on what kind of information can nudge individuals' donation behaviors, among
